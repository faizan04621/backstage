# BackStage

The aim is to simplify and improve the experience of developers as they interact with a company's products or services. By improving the discoverability of resources, the goal is to create a developer portal that is intuitive, user-friendly, and helps developers be more productive and successful in their work. Backstage helps companies to improve their developer engagement.

## Developer Portal

A developer portal is a platform or website that provides access to resources and tools for developers. It often includes API documentation, sample code, technical articles, forums, and other resources that help developers integrate with a company's products or services. The goal of a developer portal is to support and empower developers to build applications that integrate with the company's offerings.

## API Documentation

It's a reference manual for developers, helping them to understand the capabilities of the APIs, how to make calls to them, and what to expect in return. It provides all the information developers need to effectively integrate with and use the APIs, including:
- the methods,
- parameters,
- request and response formats,
- error codes, and
- any other relevant details.

API documentation is a critical component of a developer portal.

## Sample Code

Sample code is a working code snippet that demonstrates how to implement a specific functionality or feature using an API or software development kit (SDK).

## Forum

Forum is a space for developers to:
- ask technical questions,
- discuss challenges they're facing, and
- collaborate with others in real time.

## Microservices

It is a style in which a large application is built as a suite of small, independent services. The goal of microservices is to create highly scalable and maintainable systems that are easy to develop, test, and deploy.

## Architecture

Backstage is constructed out of three parts:
- **Core**: Basic functionality of Backstage
- **App**: Instance of Backstage
- **Plugins**: Additional and customize functionalities

## Plugin

Adds specific functionality to an existing program. In Backstage, plugins are written in JavaScript or TypeScript.

### Installing Plugins

Plugins are typically installed as React components.

### Three forms of plugins

1. **Standalone**
   - It runs entirely in the browser.

2. **Service-backed plugins**
   - Service-backed plugins make API requests to a service within the purview of the organization running Backstage.

3. **Third-Party Backed plugins**
   - The plugin is hosted outside of the ecosystem of the company hosting Backstage.

## What Can Backstage Do?

Manage all your:
- Services,
- Software, tooling, and
- Testing Backstage.

Start building a new microservice using an automated template in Backstage. Create, maintain, and find the documentation for all that software in Backstage.

## Backstage Software Catalog

The Backstage Software Catalog is a centralized system that keeps track of ownership and metadata for all the software in your ecosystem.

### Software Catalog enables two main use cases:

1. Helping teams manage and maintain the software they own.
2. Makes all the software in your company, and who owns it, discoverable.

## Backstage Software Templates

Backstage provides software templates as a way to quickly create new software components with pre-defined configurations and best practices.

### Templates can include predefined:

- architecture,
- dependencies, and
- CI/CD pipeline configurations.

Making it easier for developers to get started with new projects and ensure that they follow established standards.

## BackStage TechDocs

TechDocs provides a number of features to help teams manage their documentation, such as:
- versioning,
- collaboration, and
- publishing workflows.

Backstage TechDocs provides a centralized platform for managing and publishing technical documentation, making it easier for teams to:
- collaborate,
- share information, and
- ensure that their documentation is up-to-date and accurate.

## SSO to Integrate with Okta

### SSO

Single Sign-On (SSO) is a technology that allows users to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials. In SSO, a user logs in once to an SSO service and then is able to access various applications without having to log in again. SSO provides several benefits, including:
- improved security,
- improved user experience, and
- increased efficiency.

### Okta

Okta is a popular cloud-based identity and access management (IAM) platform. Okta offers a range of features to help organizations manage and secure their digital identities, including:
- single sign-on (SSO),
- multi-factor authentication (MFA),
- user provisioning and de-provisioning, and
- access management.

### Integration of SSO with Okta

1. Create an Okta account.
2. Add our application.
3. Configure the SSO settings.

## Branding Options and Customizations

Backstage provides a range of branding options and customizations to allow organizations to personalize the platform and align it with their brand and style. These options include:
- custom logos and branding colors,
- custom templates,
- custom domains, and
- custom integrations.

## APIs

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are a set of protocols. An API defines the way that different software components should interact, allowing them to work together to achieve a specific task. Backstage provides APIs that allow organizations to:
- integrate the platform with other tools and systems,
- automate various processes, and
- build custom applications on top of the platform.

The APIs provided by Backstage are designed to be easy to use and flexible, allowing organizations to take full advantage of the platform and meet their specific needs.

## Tech Radar

A tech radar is a visual representation of a company's current and future technology adoption decisions. In Backstage, tech radar is a standalone plugin. The tech radar in Backstage can help teams to:
- make informed decisions about new technologies and tools,
- prioritize their adoption, and
- keep track of their progress.
